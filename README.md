SO, you think you can test this bot by just texting in telegram? hah, naive. 
> IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING, YOU EAT SHEAT, EAT DICH...

that's what I often say but not i always do.
- ### First, you will need to create a bot by botFather from telegram
- ### After that, you will get a bot with a token, then replace your token in main()
- ### Then, run main.py and test this bot in telegram
## USABLE COMMAND AT PRESENT:
- /hello : say hello to you in Vietnamese as I say before, that's it!
- /news: get 5 newest article, you can change how many news you want to get and their source at source code.
- /shopping "<what you want>"_<number of results> or /shopping "<what you want>" with 10 results as default.
## WHY I AM DOING THIS?
I don't even know... it's just... I want to do something and I did this. ok?

Thanks for watching my stupid project :D, and have a good time dude.

You can find a way to host your bot on cloud and use it everytime you want with your own custom. But wanting me to host my bot? nah nah
